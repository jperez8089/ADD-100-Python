'''Task:

Create a Python program that uses a generator function to produce all possible two-letter combinations from a given list of characters. For example, if the list is ['a', 'b', 'c'], the program should generate 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc'.
Instructions:

        Define a generator function two_letter_combinations that takes a list of characters as an argument.
        Use nested loops within the generator function to iterate over the list of characters. In each iteration, concatenate two characters and use the yield statement to yield the two-letter combination.
        In the main method, call the generator function with a list of characters and iterate over the generator to print each combination. Create an original  5-letter list.
        Include comments in your code to explain the logic behind the generator function and the use of the yield statement.

#gen fnction with the yield statement
def two_letter_combinaton(characters):
#this wil get us all 2 letter com binatiosn form the characters
  for char1 in characters:
    for char2 in characters:
      yield char1 + char2

def main():
  #the list of characters based off the lettter list

  characters = ['f','i','v','e','s']

  combo = two_letter_combinaton(characters)

  #for l to ieterate 
  for combination in combo:
    print(combination)

main()
