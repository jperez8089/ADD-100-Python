'''The point of this program is to demonstrate the ability to make variables and using operations
 by performing a simple calculation'''

# declaring an variable for length
length = 3
# declaring an variable for width
width = 6
# Caluclating the area using the formula by involving the 2 variables  - the area will be a variable itself holding lxw 
area = length * width

#printing the area formula 
print("The area of a rectangle with a length of:", length, "and a width of: ", width, "is: ", area)
